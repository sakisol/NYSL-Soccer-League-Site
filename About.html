        <h4>MISSION</h4>
        <p>
          To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighborhoods,
          who have an interest in learning and playing soccer, with
          opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the game of
          soccer, specifically those skills around team cooperation and good
          sportsmanship.
        </p>
        <h4>VISION</h4>
        <p>
          The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong,
          well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the building of character,
          self-discipline, and leadership.
        </p>
        <h4>GENERAL INFORMATION</h4>
        <p>
          The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
          athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment
          in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be
          between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside
          neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on
          the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.
